1) Qt: 
  - Download the Qt online installer from http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/
  
  - Install Qt.4.x.x or 5.x binary & source packages.


2) Minuit:

-i) Download latest Minuit2 located at:

      http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/snapshot/work-packages/mathlibs/minuit/release/download.html

-ii) Unpack and cd

      $ tar -xvf minuit.tar.gz -C ~/

      $ cd ~/minuit

-ii) To install follor the instructions at:

      http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/snapshot/work-packages/mathlibs/minuit/gettingStarted/autoconf.html

-iii) Make SURE that the tests in the tutorial are running as described in the link below

      http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/snapshot/work-packages/mathlibs/minuit/gettingStarted/testOutput.html

-iv) - Copy (as superuser) the miniut libraries from  minuit/src/.lib/liblcg_Minuit.* to /usr/lib/

      $ sudo cp minuit/src/.lib/liblcg_Minuit.* /usr/lib/

-v) - Update ldconfig

      $ sudo ldconfig

3) MUD: 

-i) Download the MUD library source archive mud.tar.gz from http://musr.ca/mud.

     $ wget http://musr.ca/mud/mud.tar.gz

-i) downloand and Unpack  xmgr from https://github.com/mlund/xmgr-resurrection

     $ wget https://github.com/mlund/xmgr-resurrection/archive/master.zip

     $ unzip master.zip -d ~/

     $ cd ~/xmgr-resurrection-master

-ii) XMGR has a feature of displaying the copyright each time it starts from a terminal.
     This can obscure the user from seen the error messages produced by bnmroffice.
     To avoid this, comment the lines 107-111 in main.c and save.

iii) Typically the following packages are required: libice-dev libx11-dev lesstif2-dev libxmu-dev libxpm-dev.
     Install if not found in your OS. Try, on ubunto/related systems, get-all (or your system's alternative).

    $ sudo get-all install libice-dev libx11-dev lesstif2-dev libxmu-dev libxpm-dev

-iv) Read README.md to compile the code. Each system is different; try these given steps:

    $ cmake . -DENABLE_NETCDF=on

    $ cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local

    $ make

    $ sudo make install

-v) If all went well, open the execuatble "xmgr" located likely in src/ or somewhere else within your folder.

-vi) You must locate this file and copy it to /usr/bin /usr/local/bin/ and if it is not already there.

     $ sudo cp xmgr /usr/bin/

     $ sudo cp xmgr /usr/local/bin/

-ii) change the path to bnmr Data, and bnqr Data as defined in constants.h

    $ gedit src/constants.h

-iii) If Qt binaries are not in your path, set the env (Must locate where qmake is)

    $ PATH=/usr/Qt/5.4/gcc_64/bin:$PATH  (change "/usr/Qt/5.4/gcc_64/bin" as per your system)
    $ export PATH
